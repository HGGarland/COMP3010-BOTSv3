This repository contains my submission for Coursework 2 of the COMP3010 Security Operations & Incident Management module.

The analysis focuses on ingesting and querying logs (e.g., AWS CloudTrail, S3 access logs, Windows host monitoring, and hardware) using Splunk to answer the guided quiz questions. I'VE used the findings to construct an incident narrative, reflect on SOC roles and methodologies, and provide recommendations.

My report is available in Full Report.pdf.
